                was born in Washington state. I moved to Pennsylvania when I was
                real young and have lived here ever since. I hope to make a good
                impression, and I'm excited to see what we can all do together!

            I was first introduced to web development / coding years ago.
            Originally, I was trying to develop a website to host my guitar
            videos. This site would allow users to download tabs and other
            things related to the songs. I never actually finished it, but it
            allowed me to get a taste of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on a friend of mine recommended me to learn C# to learn app
            development. I later switched to JavaScript, but this was the first
            programming language I actually learned. I wanted to create an
            exercise app that would allow me to automate a lot of the tracking
            that I currently do. I had trouble creating a visual product so that
            lead me back to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            After going through a couple of jobs and realizing how much I
            enjoyed programming, I knew I needed to make a shift. There's
            something to love about the process of beating your head against a
            wall, but perservering through that adversity. Once you finally
            succeed the feeling is incredible.

            I've been seriously lifting for around the last year and a half. I
            started out getting light headed deadlifting 135 lbs and now I'm
            projected to hit into the
            <span class="text-yellow">high 400s low 500s</span> at the end of my
            cycle. My weightlifting and programming journey have been entwined
            in each other. Using JavaScript to write scripts for Google Maps,
            and my desire to make an application that fits all of my needs.

          <p>
            My wife has been very supportive of me. She's listened to me ramble
            on about programming topics and does her best to understand what I'm
            saying. I hope that through this course I can continue to make her
            proud of me.
